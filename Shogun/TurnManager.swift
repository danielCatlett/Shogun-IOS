    ***THIS IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE AS DEVELOPMENT CONTINUES***
 Turn manager is for handling the users interaction with the board.
 It does not control the flow of the game, or decide to start a new turn,
 it simply carries out what must be done to the board within a turn. It also
 creates a battle object and tell it to begin combat when it is time to do so.
 Turn manager does not have direct access to the player objects.
