/*                        ***DRAFT***
    ***THIS IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE AS DEVELOPMENT CONTINUES***
 The game class is for controlling the flow of the game. It tells the
 Turn Manager what to do, bridges the gap between the players and the board,
 and keeps track of pieces that are not specific to any one player
 (such as the castles)
